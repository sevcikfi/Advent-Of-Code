# Advent-Of-Code

Each section concerns only one year in descending order newest to oldest.
However i'll eventually come around and finish older years.

| Year | how many done |  When |
|:----:|:-------------:|------:|
| 2021 | 1-4           | early dec |
| 2022 | 1-9,11        | early to mid dec |
| 2023 | 0             | -- |

## 2023

Goals for 2023:

- [ ] do more than the year before (11 days)
- [ ] manage 3rd
- [ ] solve half of puzzles
- [ ] tackle 2/3 (16-18)
- [ ] ideally, finish the whole things
- [ ] bonus: use more than one language/something else than Python
- [ ] bonus: use unit tests

Reflection after finishing:

**`TODO write here`** around New Year

### Day 1-XX

## 2022

Goal for 2022:

- [x] do more than the year before (4 days)
- [x] manage 3rd
- [ ] solve half of puzzles
- [ ] tackle 2/3 (16-18)
- [ ] ideally, finish the whole things

Reflection after finishing:

**`TODO write here`**

### Day 01-03

very basic warm-up reading input and doing basic things

- parsing numbers and counting them
- rock-paper-scissors game
- letter intersection between strings

### Day 04

math interval intersection - **test input algo correctness check and unit tests**

### Day 05

moving objects between containers remembering their order - **awful initial state parsing, 5m hand edit >> 2 hours auto parser**

### Day 06

sliding window on an input

### Day 07

tree search and back propagation - in this case, sizes of folders in filesystem - various possible solution: *basic-tree*, *dataclass/fancy object structure*, *Pathlib simulation*, **dictionary with absolute paths as key** (some global state mess)

### Day 08

2d array of tree heights, calculation of tree *visibility* and *scenic score* based on the height - **for-loop hell**

### Day 09

not done yet

### Day 10

very super basic CPU instruction execution simulator with art printout in 2nd part - **side effect hell** (global state babysitting)

### Days 11-24

FIXME: not done just yet

## 2021

first 4 kinda
